        <p>There are three pseudo-classes
            that allow you to change the
            appearance of elements when a
            user is interacting with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="types">
        <h3>:hover</h3>
        <p>This is applied when a user
            hovers over an element with a
            pointing device such as a mouse.
            This has commonly been used
            to change the appearance of
            links and buttons when a user
            places their cursor over them. It
            is worth noting that such events
            do not work on devices that use
            touch screens (such as the iPad)
            because the screen is not able to
            tell when someone is hovering
            their finger over an element.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="types">
        <h3>:active</h3>
        <p>This is applied when an element
            is being activated by a user; for
            example, when a button is being
            pressed or a link being clicked.
            Sometimes this is used to make
            a button or link feel more like it
            is being pressed by changing the
            style or position of the element
            slightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="types">
        <h3>:focus</h3>
        <p>This is applied when an element
            has focus. Any element that
            you can interact with, such as a
            link you can click on or any form
            control can have focus.</p>
        <p>Focus occurs when a browser
            discovers that you are ready to
            interact with an element on the
            page. For example, when your
            cursor is in a form input ready
            to accept typing, that element
            is said to have focus. It is also possible to use the tab key on
            your keyboard to move through
            the interactive items on a page.
            When pseudo-classes are
            used, they should appear in this
            order: :link, :visited, :hover,
            :focus, :active.f</p>
